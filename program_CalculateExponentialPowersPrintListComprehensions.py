## Write a program using for loops (in Java, JavaScript, C, or Python) that prints out:
## 1.) the numbers 1 through 10 on the first line,
## 2.) the squares of 1 through 10 on the second line (e.g. 1, 4, 9...),

## CALCULATIONS
for each in ListOfIntegers:
   
    ListNew = [each**count for each in ListOfIntegers] ## PYTHON LIST COMPREHENSION

    print(ListNew, "count = ", count) ## PRINT OUTPUT - TESTING PUPOSES
